Comparing various *schedules* for *OpenMP-based* **vector element sum**.

Two floating-point vectors `x` and `y`, with number of **elements** from `1E+6`
to `1E+9` were multiplied using OpenMP. Each element count was attempted with
various **OpenMP schedule configs**, running each config 5 times to get a good
time measure. Sum here represents any `reduce()` operation that processes
several values to a single value. Results indicate a **num-threads** of `32`,
and a **schedule-kind** of `auto` to be suitable (for **float**).

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets].
