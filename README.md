Performance of *sequential* vs *OpenMP-based* **vector element sum**.

This experiment was for comparing the performance between:
1. Find `Σx` using a single thread (**sequential**).
2. Find `Σx` accelerated using **OpenMP**.

Here `x` is a floating-point vector. Both approaches were attempted on a number
of vector sizes, running each approach 5 times per size to get a good time
measure. Note that neither approach makes use of *SIMD instructions* which are
available on all modern hardware. While it might seem that **OpenMP** method
would be a clear winner, the results indicate it is dependent upon the workload.
Results indicate that **from 10⁵ elements, OpenMP** **approach performs better**
than sequential.
